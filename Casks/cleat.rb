  # An upgrade quits the old daemon, and a clean quit is exactly what KeepAlive leaves alone, so
  # the new one has to be asked for. The kickstart is the normal path and works once the agent has
  # been registered; on a first install, or a first upgrade from a version that had no agent,
  # there is no job to kick, so the app itself is started instead. That copy registers the agent
  # and then hands over to the one launchd starts, so either way exactly one daemon is left.
